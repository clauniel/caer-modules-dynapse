#! SRAM not overflow
# Everything i connect in the same chips connected before does not create overflow
# ...every SRAM is adapted to the new routings. In this example it is exploited multi-core routing
# because the destination neurons are in different cores. In case the destination neuron is 
# in the same core, only CAM is written
